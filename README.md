Serverless Web App using AWS (Lambda + DynamoDB + S3)

This is a simple serverless web app I built using AWS â€” no EC2, just pure serverless setup.  
In this project, you will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **DynamoDB** â†’ Stores the data (NoSQL table)
- **AWS Lambda** â†’ Handles all backend logic (CRUD operations)
- **S3** â†’ Hosts the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **CloudFront** â†’ Delivers the site globally (fast + secure)
- **Route 53** â†’ For custom domain setup
---

## Tech Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js / Python)
- Database: DynamoDB
- Hosting: S3 + CloudFront

---

## Setup Steps

1. **Created a DynamoDB table** (partition key = `id`)
2. Wrote a **Lambda function** that handles all CRUD
3. Uploaded my HTML, CSS & JS to an **S3 bucket**
4. Enabled **static website hosting** on the S3 bucket
5. Set up **CloudFront** to serve the S3 content
